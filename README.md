# Lazy Evaluation Simple Language (LESL)

- System on which your compiler and runtime are built (GNUstep, Linux, Unix, Windows or MacOS)  
Our language (LESL) works on primarily Linux based systems like Ubuntu and MacOS.
- Tools used  
We have used Python and Prolog to build our language.
- Directions/instructions to install your language  
Our language does not need to be installed. LESL has only 2 dependencies - Python 2.x and SWI Prolog.
- Directions/instructions to build and run your language (compiler/runtime)     
Run the one line in the bash script. That line will run sample.lbsl automatically if you do not mention filename. However, if you want to run your file, you should create a file having extention, ".lbsl" and write the filename in front of the command given below. There are 5 sample codes given in 'data' folder, I've pasted the output of each file in respective file itself.

- ONE LINE of bash script that builds the compiler and ONE LINE that runs the runtime    
Go to project directory.    
python lbsl.py sample.lbsl
